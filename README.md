# Polynomial-regression-model

Overview

This project implements a polynomial regression model to predict office space prices based on their features. The model uses a quadratic polynomial equation to capture non-linear relationships between features and prices.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run python (link unavailable) to train the model.

Model Details
Polynomial degree: 2 (quadratic)
Features: 1 (office space feature)
Target variable: Office space price
Training data: 100 samples
Test data: New data points for prediction
